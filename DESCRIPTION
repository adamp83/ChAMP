Title: Chip Analysis Methylation Pipeline for Illumina HumanMethylation450 and EPIC
Version: 1.11.1
Date: 2016-04-25
Description: The package includes quality control metrics, a selection
        of normalization methods and novel methods to identify
        differentially methylated regions and to highlight copy number
        alterations. In addition there is a method to help calculate hmC using BS and oxBS samples.
